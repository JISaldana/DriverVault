# DriverVault 

This project will develop a **Python-based tool** for **backing up and restoring drivers** using `pnputil`.  

- **A feature will be implemented** to **export installed drivers** to a user-selected location.  
- **Disk space will be checked** before backup, prompting the user to free space or change the destination if necessary.  
- **An option will be added** to **compress the drivers into a `.zip` file** after exporting.  
- **The tool will allow** **installing drivers from a saved package**, verifying its integrity before installation.  
- **An activity log will be generated** to keep track of all backups and installations.  

In future updates, **a PyQt-based GUI will be developed** to enhance the user experience.
